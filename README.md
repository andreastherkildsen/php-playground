# php-playground
A playground where i develop ideas, patterns or a bunch of random stuff i think off when i cant sleep. 

## Abstract
The main objective with the project was to playaround with a mixture of
native PHP and composer packages, with emphasis on native PHP. The folder structure is somewhat PSR - i cannot
say the same for the code standard(...soon). 

## Brainstorming of end goal
Hence i work in a data driven company i want to do something with API(s), a database and 
visualisation - A small dashboard maybe, maybe even automated. 

## Architecture and standards 
- Somewhat modularized MVC pattern and WWFY(Whatefter works for you)
